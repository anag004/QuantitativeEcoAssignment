India: We can see that FDI rises sharply in the 1990s after the govt. opened up the economy for freer trade. This was followed by an increase in India's GDP stimulated by foreign investment. The graph thus decreases as the growth means that FDI now is smaller relative to the total GDP. The govt. is still trying to further liberalize trade.

USA: Being one of the early countries to develop and adopt open capitalist markets, we can see that FDI in USA forms a significant portion of their GDP from early on. The ever-present large fluctuations in the FDI are indicative of the unpredictable nature of FDI.

Brazil: A similar pattern is seen here as for India, where Brazil saw a huge spike in FDI in the 2000s following trade liberalization

China: This country is the second largest recipient of FDI in the world. The increase in FDI is because of government policies favoring corporations, many of which set up factories to manufacture products in China. 

Russia: After the fall of the Soviet Union and the rise of capitalism, FDI in this country has steadily increased (uptil 2010)

Plots for other developed (UK, France, Germany, Japan) and developing (Argentina, Indonesia) are shown. 

A few notable examples are:

Germany: A huge spike in FDI observed in Feb 2000. 
Japan: A huge dip in FDI was observed in 2007
Indonesia: Has an inverted FDI curve, with a dip near 2000

Overall, we see that FDI in all countries increased near the dawn of the millenium due to trade liberalization and increased interest from investors. This decreased later on due to a variety of factors, for example increasing GDP of the countries. There are exceptions in the highly irregular data, indicating that FDI is very fickle and easily influenced by govt. policy and the whims of investors.
